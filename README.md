## DISCLAIMER:

I develop this library on my spare time, which implies that: 

1. this has nothing to do with my daily job

2. there is absolutely no warranty about this library


## FunFEM 

FunFEM is a finite element method (to be) written with the functional language Haskell. 

The idea is for me to learn a functional language and thinking in terms of functional programming. I saw no FEM library, and I thought that it would be nice to add my stone to the community.

Feel free to contact me at adrien [at] funfem [dot] org for more information about this project. Any contribution welcome !
